## Introduction

Fuzzy systems play a vital role in various domains, including artificial intelligence, control systems, and decision-making processes. This repository serves as a hub for all hands-on materials related to the Fuzzy System lectures conducted at PUC-Rio. It includes code examples, tutorials, and other educational resources to help you master the concepts of fuzzy logic and its applications.

## Contents

This repository includes the following:

1. **[Hands-on #01](https://github.com/mdrs-thiago/PUC_FuzzyLogic/blob/main/Hands-on%20%2301%20-%20Fuzzy%20System.ipynb) -** Python Notebook file containing the basic usage of scikit-fuzzy library.

2. **[Hands-on #02](https://github.com/mdrs-thiago/PUC_FuzzyLogic/blob/main/Hands-on%20%2302%20-%20Control.ipynb) -** Python Noteboon file contaning classic control examples using scikit-fuzzy and OpenAI Gym. This file also shows a simple fuzzy-genetic approach for control optimization.
